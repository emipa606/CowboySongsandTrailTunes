Update of Tamiass mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1413217295

**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md)**.
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the previous version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2397968000).

- Removed the need for having the Westernization mod active
- This mod simply enables the cowboy tunes from [Rimworld Westernization Project](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2237100861) to be played on the radio and gramophone in [Industrial Age - Objects and Furniture](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2249289906)

Howdy again, partner! Need some old-timey western music to play in that fancy new saloon you just built? No problem! No music for that barnyard hoedown you were planning? Rimworld Westernization Project: Cowboy Songs and Trail Tunes has you covered! This mod allows you to play 13 new cowboy and western themed songs from both the gramophone and radio included in Jecrell's Call of Cthulu - Industrial Age mod. Some of these songs are more contemporary, but several are actual cowboy trail songs from the 19th century (1800s).

2. Man of Constant Sorrow - The Soggy Bottom Boys

*Credits and Acknowledgements*

First, all credit for these songs belong to their respective artists. Many of these songs are over a century old, but I still highly encourage you to purchase from and support the artists of any songs you enjoy from this selection, as this type of music is in many ways a dying artform.

Secondly, I have to thank Jecrell, the creator of JecsTools and Call of Cthulhu - Industrial Age.
